# Handling ‘JQuery Calendar’ in an IFRAME
# There are many scenarios where you would want to place the Calendar control inside an iFrame. In such cases,
# before performing any operation on the date picker, you have to first switch to that iFrame.

# Once inside the iFrame, you should perform the following operations:
# Step 1:  Click on the Calendar Control to open the same.
# Step 2:  Find the Year drop-down control and select the required year from that drop-down.
# Step 3:  Find the Month drop-down control and select the required month from that drop-down.
# Step 4:  Once year and month is selected, locate the corresponding date by navigating through the Date table.
# I’ll use jQuery’s date picker demo URL as the test URL to demonstrate how to automate calendar using Selenium
# WebDriver when the calendar is inside the iFrame.
