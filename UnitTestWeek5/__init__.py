# Follow your instructor to complete the following steps and create your own basic unit tests

# Steps
# 1. First create a python package called UnitTestWeek5(or you can select your own name too)
# 2. By default a __init__.py file is created. The __init__.py file lets the Python interpreter know that
# a directory contains code for a Python module. An __init__.py file can be blank. Without one, you cannot
# import modules from another folder into your project. The file essentially the constructor of your package
# or directory without it being called such. It sets up how packages or functions will be imported into
# your other files.
# 3. Create two more python packages app and test with Unit Test python package. app would contain
# your codes to be tested. test would contain test cases files in it.
# 4.Create addition.py for basic addition. It does not check the data types of the objects passed to the
# class
# 5. Create test_addition.py as test file which will have one one test passed one test failed
# 6. Create addition01.py where objects passed can be only integers, otherwise it should through error
# 7. Create test_addition01.py as test case file for addition01.py where both tests would pass as it's
#    now taking care of the data types of the objects.
